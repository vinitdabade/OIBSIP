            <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar </b>(14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, 
              economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the 
              Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice 
              minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

              Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, and studied economics at Columbia University and the 
              London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923 respectively and was among a handful of Indian students to 
              have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, 
              professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's 
              independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment 
              of the state of India. 
              In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military 
            cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) 
            (now in Madhya Pradesh).[15] He was the 14th and last child of 
            Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar,
             and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[16] His family
              was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe 
              (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day 
              Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste,
               who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic
                discrimination.[17] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the
                 army of the British East India Company, and his father served
                  in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.[18] 
                  Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable
                   children were segregated and given little attention or help
                    by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class.
                     When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher 
                     caste had to pour that water from a height as they were 
                     not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that 
                     contained it. This task was usually performed for the young
                      Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not 
                      available then he had to go without water; he described 
                      the situation later in his writings as "No peon, 
                      No Water".[19] He was required to sit on a gunny sack 
                      which he had to take home with him.
